# Preamble

Most license are designed to be "serious" and "useful". I, on the other hand, hold on to the belief that
software should be fun. How 'bout we leave licenses incomprehensible to man, machine, and lawyer to Oracle
and Microsoft? Btw, in case it still hasn't caught your attention: This document is formatted using Markdown.
If your device can't read it, I offer my deepest, most sincere condolences and advise you to consider
purchasing usable devices rather than the overpriced e-waste some companies market as technology to the
inept masses. I object to paying idiot taxes on my devices. Nonetheless, I hope you find more uses for
this unholy union of paradigms I have successfully marketed as code than I have.
The spaghetti is strong with this one; remember to bring your towel.

# License

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated
material, including but not limited to, documentation, tooling, and assets, which shall henceforth be
referred to as "the software", to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense copies of the
software, solange as the following terms are adhered to:

0. This license is only valid starting from the year 2023 a.d. Time travelers may not exercise any
rights granted by the license before that date.

1. This license applies to all files contained within this directory which have been created by Christoph 
Neumann. This means all code and documentation save that, which has been provided by third party libraries.

2. Licensees are adressed using "you".

3. You may copy, distribute, and publish verbatim copies of the software so long as you distribute this
license with it and inform the receiver of it, as well as not claim and/or hint that this work is your own,
be it by explicit statement, omission, ambiguous wording or otherwise. You may charge a fee for the act of
transferring a copy by whatever means you choose. You may offer warranty protection, support and similar 
services in exchange for a fee. In addition, you agree to warn potential users of the software of this
project whenever possible.

4. You may modify your copy or any portion thereof, thus creating a derivative work, and copy and distribute
such modifications in accordance with these terms, section 3 in particular, provided the following 
conditions are met:
    1. All modifications must be clearly and unambiguously labeled as such.
    2. You must license all work, that in whole or part, is derived from the software or any part thereof,
    under the terms of this license and at no charge to all third parties.
    3. You must alter any licensing information in the compiled work in such a manner that,
    upon distribution, it is clearly to all users that the compiled work has been altered. This includes
    command line output referring to the original author, as well as other such references. 

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections, which
can reasonably be considered independant and separate works in themselves, then this License and its terms
are not applicable to any such sections when distributed separately from the original.
If distributed in conjunction with the remainder of the software or derivatives thereof, those sections too, 
are subject to the terms of this license and thus the entire derivative work, including such sections, is 
subject to this license and its terms, regardless of the extent of its connection to the original or
its author. 

It is not the intend of this section to claim rights over your sole work; rather, it is intended that the
software stays free as it is built upon by different entities. 

Mere aggregation of other work(s) not based on the software or work based thereon on the same storage volume,
medium, folder, or similar does not bring such work under the scope of this license.

5. You agree to warn potential users of this software where possible.

6. You may distribute executable artifacts of the software or work based
thereon(under the terms of section 4) under the terms of sections 3, 4, and 5, so long as you do at least
one of the following:
    1. Provide a machine readable copy of the source code on a medium customary for such exchanges and 
    accessible without any payment to the receiver under the terms of sections 3, 4, and 5; or,
    2. Provide a written offer, valid for at least 5 years, to provide any third party with a copy
    of the source code in a machine readable format for a charge of no more than the cost of distribution to
    said party on a medium customary for such exchanges and accessible without charge to the other party
    under the terms of sections 3, 4, and 5; or,
    3. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute the original source code.
    This option is only allowed for noncommercial distribution and only if you received such an offer
    in accordance with the preceding section.

Source code in this context refers to the prefered medium for viewing, modifying, and compiling the software.
Source code includes all source, as well as interface files, other files accessed and required by the 
executable at runtime which you have been provided with as part of the software, as well as any documentation
included in the software, the readme file, and as per sections 3 and 4, these license terms. This means
that, ideally, you should distribute the entire repository.

If the executable is made available by offer of access at a designated place, then offering access to a copy
of the source code in the same place satisfies the requirement of distribution. 

7. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, use, distribute, or otherwise utilize the software or work based 
on it in accordance with section 4, except as expressly permitted under the terms of this license. 
Any attempt to copy, modify, sublicense, use, distribute, or otherise utilize the software is void
and automatically and irrevocably revokes all your rights under this license. Parties which have
received copies, or copies of derivatives under section 4, of this work will not have their rights terminated
so long as such parties remain in compliance and such parties have been provided with the correct licensing 
terms. 

8. You are not required to accept this license. However, without it, you have no right to this work
save for use to the extent permitted by law. By copying, modifying, sublicensing, using, distributing, or
otherwise utilizing this work outside the basic rights granted by applicable law, you indicate acceptance
of the licensing terms of the software.

9. Each receiver of copies of the software distributed by you automatically receives a license from the
original licensor as per these terms. You may not impose further restrictions on those rights. 

10. If, as a consequence of court judgement, local legislation, or for any other reason, conditions 
of such origin contradicts the conditions of this license, they do not excuse you from the licensing
conditions. If you cannot follow all terms of the license, your license is considered null and void; in that
case you have not right to the software. 

If part of the license is invalid in your jurisdiction under certain circumstances, then the remainder of
the license remains valid in those cases and the full license remains applicable in all other cases.

11. Section 10 only applies if you already hold a license in a country with such restrictions. You are not 
allowed to knowingly distribute the software to any country where the license terms are impossible to satisfy
and/or not applicable. 

12. Military or otherwise violent use of the software is forbidden; you may not use this software
for war or to otherwise inflict harm in any way, shape or form, physical or psychological.

13. Section 12 does not apply if force is used against people who hurt cats.

14. By using this software you agree to always be silly.

15. If you copy, use, modify, distribute, or otherwise utilize the software on devices running proprietary
operating systems, you agree to wash your hands afterwards. If the offending device is running software by
Apple Inc., you must also disinfect them after each interaction.

16. Don't be evil

17. You agree never to contact the author about problems in the software unless you already are in regular
contact with the author. 

18. All above restrictions are void in the event of the occurrence of a widespread viral infection
transmitted via bites or contact with bodily fluids that causes human corpses to reanimate and seek to
consume living human flesh, blood, brain or nerve tissue and is likely to result in the fall
of organized civilization; or, in the event of invasions from outer space. In such cases, you agree to
do your best to go down with style. 

19. If you got this far through the agreement and also understand how the software works, please contact
me as I believe communication with you would be worthwhile.

20. If you are an idiot, your license is null and void and all rights granted by the license are terminated.
Furthermore, you may only exercise the rights granted under this license if you know how to use a shell.

21. Upon accepting this license, you agree to read at least 4 books per year.

22. Licensees agree not to drink Murauer beer if other options are available.
